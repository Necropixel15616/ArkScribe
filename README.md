<h1>ArkScribe: Breeding Documentation</h1>

This Project was a Collaboration between myself and lachelle-anne. Huge thanks to them for helping me out with the interface!

ArkScribe is a Breeding Documentation software for Ark: Survival Evolved. It will keep track of your current projects and the stats of those projects. It can also adapt if somebody is running the Structures Plus mod and using the S+ Mutator.
